# Preparing the first call

All you need for the first call is a browser. For example Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera etc. Very likely one of these browsers is installed.

But it is much better to use the Teams app. If you don't have it yet, installing it is very easy:

## Installing Teams

- go to [microsoft.com/teams](https://microsoft.com/teams) and download Teams
- install the Teams program you have just downloaded

## Signing in to Teams

- when starting Teams for the first time, you have two options: 1️⃣ sign in with a Microsoft account and 2️⃣ join a call with a Meeting Link or Meeting ID
- if you have a Microsoft account and if you know your e-mail and password, sign in to Teams
- if you are unable to sign-in, you can still join a Teams meeting by clicking on the Meeting Link or by entering the Meeting ID and passcode
