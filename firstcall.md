- for the first MakeFest call, you will receive an e-mail with a link
- to join the call, just open the e-mail on your computer and click on the link
- a browser should open and give you two options:
  1. join the call in the browser
  2. join the call with the Teams program
- if the Teams program is installed on your computer, you can choose the second option
- if that does not work or you don't have the Teams program installed, just choose the first option to join in the browser
