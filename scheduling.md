# Course scheduling

## Introduction

For each course, we need to find a day and time that works for all participants. 

Experience shows that sometimes this can be a little tricky.

The first step we take is to ask **everyone** for **all** the times that they **could** be available.

We do that with the website [WhenIsGood](https://www.whenisgood.net). For each course, the coach creates a separate online poll on WhenIsGood and shares the link to that poll with all participants.

Each poll lists all the 15-minute intervals when the coach is available. If times are missing, it's because the coach is not available. 

Of course, you normally won't be available during many of these intervals and maybe you will only be available during a few. That's fine! Just check all the intervals that would work for **you**. 

The coach can then check on WhenIsGood which intervals work for **all** participants.

## Picking course slots

Some courses have 2h per week, others 90 minutes.

Depending on participants, we may choose a single day or we split the course over two separate days.

## Instructions

- You don't need to click on each and every interval. Instead you can click, hold and drag the mouse over the intervals you want.
- A given interval starts at the time shown on the interval and ends 15 minutes later

> [!TIP]
>  **Example**: if you want to indicate that on some day you are available until 6:00 pm, the last interval you check is 5:45 pm but not 6:00 pm

- don't just indicate the intervals where you would **like** the course to take place; instead, indicate **all** intervals that you would be **ok** with; the reason is that we need to find a time that works for **all** participants

> [!TIP]
> **Example**: if you can make intervals 3:00 to 3:45, and you can also make 2:45 and 4:00, please indicate both of these slots as well

- only check intervals if you are available for at least half the weekly course duration, including that interval, so either 1h or 45 minutes

> [!TIP]
>  **Example**: if your course is 2h per week and you can make intervals 3:15 to 3:45, but you cannot make 3:00 nor 4:00, don't indicate 3:15 to 3:45 at all

- please only indicate slots if you are confident that you can be online at that time on a regular basis; being late on occasion is not a problem but being late regularly disturbs the entire course
- after submitting your availabilities, WhenIsGood shows you the link where you can edit them in the future; ⚠️ so make sure to keep that link; on that same page you can ask WhenIsGood to send you an e-mail with the link; unless you are really sure about keeping the link somewhere else, it's probably a good idea you request that e-mail!

## Session dates

In most courses there are about 19 sessions.

In principle, sessions take place every week on the scheduled day and time. 

But in some weeks this doesn't work because of holidays, class trips etc.

The dates for all scheduled sessions are shared with all participants as soon as they are known. If participants have conflicts for these dates, we will try to reschedule with the goal of minimizing missed sessions.

Every participant is responsable for checking the dates and speaking up about conflicts.
